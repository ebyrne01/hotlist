# Hotlist — Project Bible for Claude Code

## What is Hotlist?
A romance & romantasy book intelligence web app. Users search for books and get ratings from Goodreads, Amazon, and romance.io aggregated in one place, plus spice levels, trope tags, and an AI-generated synopsis. The signature feature is the "Hotlist" — a comparison table where users save multiple books side by side to decide what to read next. Affiliate buy links (Amazon) monetize the app.

## Audience
Romance and romantasy readers. Mobile-first. Non-technical users. The tone is warm, editorial, and a little spicy — never corporate.

## Tech Stack (do not deviate from this)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database + Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Supabase Auth)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API (tiered approach):
  - `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for transcript extraction, synopsis generation, trope normalization, sentiment tagging, spice inference (high volume, cost-sensitive)
  - `claude-sonnet-4-6` for BookTok agent (vision + tool use for book identification, accuracy-critical, low volume)
- **Book metadata**: Google Books API + Open Library API
- **Data enrichment**: Web scraping via cheerio + node-fetch (Goodreads, Amazon). romance.io via Serper Google search (romance.io blocks direct scraping).
- **State/data fetching**: SWR

## Future iOS app
The backend is Supabase. The iOS app (Expo/React Native, built later) will connect directly to Supabase using the same project. Do NOT couple business logic to Next.js API routes — put it in Supabase (RLS policies, database functions) wherever possible so the mobile app can reuse it without a proxy.

## Key principles
1. **Mobile-first**: Design every screen for 375px wide first
2. **No auth walls**: Browsing, search, and book detail pages are public. Auth only triggers when saving to a Hotlist or rating a book
3. **Speed**: Cache aggressively. Book data from external sources should be cached in Supabase for 24 hours minimum
4. **Cost control**: Use Haiku for high-volume AI, Sonnet only for accuracy-critical BookTok tasks. Batch scraping jobs. Cache everything.
5. **Graceful degradation**: If scraping fails, show what we have. Never show a broken page.

## Data sources — canonical hierarchy

| Source | Role | What it provides |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Goodreads** | Canonical identity | Book ID, title, author, cover, rating, genres, series, description |
| **Google Books** | Metadata + provisional entries | ISBN, page count, publisher, cover. Also the source for books not yet on Goodreads. |
| **Open Library** | Metadata fallback | ISBN, page count, publisher (if Google Books misses) |
| **NYT Books API** | Discovery only | "What's Hot" row. Every NYT title resolved to Goodreads ID before storing. |
| **Amazon** | Affiliate links + rating | ASIN for buy links, ratings via Serper Google search |
| **Romance.io** | Spice ratings (high confidence) | Spice level + heat label, scraped via Serper Google search |

**Book identity rule:** Books may enter the database without a Goodreads ID (from Google Books, BookTok, imports). The enrichment queue attempts to resolve them to Goodreads. Books with a Goodreads ID get richer data (genres, series, description).

## Composite Spice Architecture

Spice scores come from 5 weighted signals stored in the `spice_signals` table. The composite engine (`/lib/spice/compute-composite.ts`) produces a weighted average:

| Source | Weight | Confidence | How it works |
|--------|--------|------------|--------------|
| `community` | 1.0 | 0.55–1.0 (scales with count) | Aggregated from user_ratings. Our data moat. |
| `romance_io` | 0.85 | ~0.85 | Scraped via Serper from romance.io pages |
| `review_classifier` | 0.6 | varies | Keyword matching on Goodreads/Amazon reviews, LLM fallback |
| `llm_inference` | 0.4 | varies | Claude Haiku reads the book description |
| `genre_bucketing` | 0.2 | ~0.2–0.5 | Rule-based from genre tags (e.g., "erotica" → 5.0) |

**Conflict detection:** When two signals disagree by >2.0 peppers, the book is flagged and attribution reads "Spice estimates vary — community ratings help!"

### Spice files (`/lib/spice/`)
- `compute-composite.ts` — weighted composite engine, batch queries
- `community-aggregation.ts` — rolls up user_ratings into community signal
- `genre-bucketing.ts` — rule-based spice from genre tags
- `llm-inference.ts` — Claude Haiku inference from descriptions (daily limit)
- `review-classifier.ts` — keyword + LLM fallback from review text
- `review-fetcher.ts` — scrapes Goodreads reviews, Serper for Amazon snippets

### Spice UI components (`/components/books/`)
- `SpiceAttribution.tsx` — shows source text with varying opacity by confidence
- `SpiceDisplay.tsx` — unified peppers + attribution, compact mode for tables

## Data model

All tables in the public schema:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `books` | Canonical book records. `goodreads_id` is UNIQUE but nullable (provisional entries). `enrichment_status`: pending → partial → complete. |
| `enrichment_queue` | Async enrichment jobs with retry logic. Job types: goodreads_detail, goodreads_rating, amazon_rating, romance_io_spice, metadata, ai_synopsis, trope_inference, review_classifier, llm_spice |
| `book_ratings` | Per-source star ratings (goodreads, amazon, romance_io) |
| `book_spice` | Legacy spice table (romance_io, hotlist_community, goodreads_inference). Being superseded by `spice_signals`. |
| `spice_signals` | New multi-signal spice table. One row per book per source. Columns: book_id, source, spice_value, confidence (0–1), evidence (JSONB). |
| `tropes` | Canonical trope list (id, slug, name, description) |
| `book_tropes` | Junction: books ↔ tropes |
| `user_ratings` | Per-user star_rating (1–5) + spice_rating (1–5) per book. DB trigger `trg_refresh_community_spice` auto-aggregates into spice_signals. |
| `reading_status` | want_to_read / reading / read per user per book |
| `hotlists` | User-created comparison lists. BookTok grabs store `source_creator_handle`, `source_video_url`, `source_video_thumbnail`, `source_platform`. |
| `hotlist_books` | Books within a hotlist (position, added_at) |
| `profiles` | Extended user data. Creator fields: `is_creator`, `creator_verified_at`, `vanity_slug` (UNIQUE), `bio`, `tiktok_handle`, `instagram_handle`, `youtube_handle`, `blog_url`, `amazon_affiliate_tag`, `bookshop_affiliate_id` |
| `creator_applications` | Self-serve creator verification requests. Status: pending → approved / rejected |
| `analytics_events` | Lightweight event tracking (profile_view, affiliate_click, etc.) |
| `homepage_cache` | Cached book ID lists for homepage rows (24h TTL) |
| `nyt_trending` | NYT bestseller entries with rank + weeks_on_list |
| `video_grabs` | BookTok pipeline cache — never process the same URL twice. Stores `video_title` (TikTok caption) for hotlist naming. |
| `grab_feedback` | User feedback on BookTok results (wrong_book, wrong_edition, missing_book). Anonymous inserts via RLS. |
| `agent_debug_logs` | Debug traces from BookTok agent runs (url, log_entries JSONB) |
| `creator_handles` | Auto-populated from video grabs. Tracks every BookTok creator. Unique on (handle, platform). |
| `creator_book_mentions` | Junction: creators ↔ books. Denormalized from video_grabs for fast queries. Includes sentiment + quote. |
| `user_follows` | Readers follow creator handles. RLS: users manage own follows. |
| `cron_logs` | Cron job execution logs |
| `pro_waitlist` | Email capture for future Pro tier |

## BookTok feature (formerly "Grab from Video")
- Video download: RapidAPI (third-party TikTok/Instagram/YouTube downloader)
- **Supports videos AND photo/carousel posts** (TikTok `/photo/` URLs with multiple slide images)
- Transcription: OpenAI Whisper API (model: whisper-1) — NOT Claude. Skipped for carousel posts.
- Frame extraction: ffmpeg for videos (up to 20 frames, subsampled to 8). Carousel posts use slide image URLs directly.
- **Book identification: Single Claude Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) agent with vision + tool use — reads covers, understands transcript, searches & confirms books on Goodreads in real time**
- **Anti-hallucination rules**: Agent never guesses books from creator handles, partial/blurry covers, or music lyrics
- Cache: `video_grabs` Supabase table — never process the same URL twice
- UI: `/app/booktok/page.tsx` (old `/app/grab/page.tsx` redirects here)
- API: `/app/api/grab/route.ts` (streaming)
- URL detection: SearchBar auto-detects video URLs and redirects to `/booktok?url=...`
- Cost: ~$0.05-0.10 per grab (vision + tool use, but only ONE Sonnet call)

### BookTok pipeline (in order):
1. Validate URL + check cache
2. Download video/audio via RapidAPI (detects carousel vs video posts)
3. Transcribe audio via Whisper + extract frames via ffmpeg (parallel). Carousel posts skip Whisper, use slide images directly.
4. Single Sonnet agent call: vision + transcript + Goodreads tool use
   → Agent reads covers, understands transcript, searches Goodreads, confirms editions, returns verified canonical results
5. Queue enrichment for all matched books + **kick off enrichment worker immediately** (fire-and-forget, no 5-min wait)
6. Cache result in `video_grabs` table (includes `video_title` from RapidAPI)
7. Register creator handle + book mentions in `creator_handles` / `creator_book_mentions` (fire-and-forget)

### Hotlist creation from grabs
- Hotlist name uses the **video title/caption** (hashtags stripped), e.g. "All the books we gave 5 stars in 2025"
- Falls back to `"@handle picks"` if no video title available
- Creator handle stored as `source_creator_handle` and displayed as a byline linking to `/discover/@handle`
- Both theme and creator handle are searchable

## Creator Discovery

- `creator_handles` table: auto-populated from video grabs, tracks every BookTok creator whose videos have been processed
- `creator_book_mentions`: denormalized junction table — which creators recommended which books, with sentiment + quotes
- `user_follows`: readers can follow creator handles
- `/discover` — browseable index of all discovered creators, with trending section
- `/discover/[handle]` — auto-generated page showing all books recommended by a creator, with follow button
- "Seen on BookTok" section on book detail pages shows which creators recommended each book
- Hotlists created from BookTok grabs use video title as name + creator handle as byline (see "Hotlist creation from grabs" above)
- Creators can claim their handle (future: upgrade to full creator profile)

## Creator Platform

Verified creators get a public profile and affiliate monetization:

- **Self-serve application**: `/profile/creator` — non-creators fill out application form → `creator_applications` table (status: pending → approved/rejected)
- **Creator settings**: Verified creators manage vanity URL, bio, social handles, Amazon affiliate tag, Bookshop.org affiliate ID
- **Public profile**: `/{vanitySlug}` — server-rendered page with avatar, bio, verified badge, social links, public hotlists with mini book covers, reading stats. Reserved word guard prevents conflicts with app routes.
- **Affiliate tag threading**: Creator's `amazon_affiliate_tag` flows through `getHotlistWithBooks()` → `HotlistDetail.ownerAffiliateTag` → `HotlistTable.affiliateTag` → Buy links. Default tag (`NEXT_PUBLIC_AMAZON_AFFILIATE_TAG`) used when no creator tag is set.
- **Auto-Hotlist creator mode**: When verified creators use BookTok grab, hotlists are auto-set to public (`is_public: true`)
- **Analytics**: `analytics_events` table tracks profile_view, affiliate_click, etc. API: `POST /api/analytics/event`

## Chrome Extension

Browser extension that meets users on Goodreads, Amazon, and video sites:

- **Manifest V3**: `extension/manifest.json`
- **Goodreads overlay** (`content-goodreads.js`): Injects spice, tropes, Amazon rating comparison below the Goodreads rating section. Auto-provisions books not in DB via lookup API.
- **Amazon overlay** (`content-amazon.js`): Injects Goodreads rating, spice, tropes on book product pages. SPA-aware via MutationObserver.
- **Video detection** (`content-video.js`): Detects TikTok/Instagram/YouTube video pages, activates popup grab.
- **Popup** (`popup.html/js`): BookTok grab UI with streaming progress, results display.
- **Backend**: `/api/books/lookup` — multi-identifier lookup (goodreads_id, isbn, asin, title+author), CORS-enabled, auto-provisioning.
- **CORS**: `lib/api/cors.ts` shared utility. All data is public, no auth needed.

## Enrichment Architecture

Book data flows through two independent systems:

### Search (fast, always works)
- Supabase full-text + trigram search on cached books
- Google Books API as a fallback for undiscovered books
- Never waits for Goodreads scraping
- Returns results in < 500ms

### Enrichment Queue (async, resilient)
- `enrichment_queue` table tracks jobs per book per source
- Job types: goodreads_detail, goodreads_rating, amazon_rating, romance_io_spice, metadata, ai_synopsis, trope_inference, review_classifier, llm_spice
- Each job retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff (30s, 2min, 10min)
- Cron worker runs every 5 minutes (`/api/cron/enrichment-worker`)
- `enrichment_status` on books table: "pending" → "partial" → "complete"
- Book detail pages poll for updates when enrichment is incomplete
- **Grab pipeline queues enrichment at grab time AND kicks off the worker immediately** (fire-and-forget `processEnrichmentQueue(30_000)`) so data is ready within seconds, not at the next 5-min cron tick
- **Hotlist pages poll** `/api/books/refresh-batch` every 8s when un-enriched books are detected, auto-stopping when data arrives
- Enrichment banner shows above the hotlist table while books are being enriched

### Files
- `/lib/enrichment/queue.ts` — queue management (add, fetch, complete, fail)
- `/lib/enrichment/worker.ts` — job processor (dispatches to appropriate enrichment function)
- `/app/api/cron/enrichment-worker/route.ts` — cron endpoint
- `/app/api/books/refresh-batch/route.ts` — batch book hydration endpoint (used by hotlist polling)

## Cron Jobs (vercel.json)

| Path | Schedule | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `/api/cron/enrichment-worker` | Every 5 min | Process pending enrichment queue jobs |
| `/api/cron/spice-backfill` | Every 6 hours | LLM inference + review classifier backfill |
| `/api/cron/refresh-spice` | Daily 4 AM UTC | Re-aggregate community signals, queue stale romance_io re-scrapes, recompute genre bucketing |
| `/api/cron/weekly-refresh` | Tuesdays 10 AM UTC | Refresh stale book data |
| `/api/cron/monthly-enrichment` | 1st of month 2 AM UTC | Bulk enrichment pass |
| `/api/cron/seed-lists` | Sundays 6 AM UTC | Seed/refresh curated book lists |
| `/api/cron/openlibrary-discovery` | Wednesdays 4 AM UTC | Discover new books via Open Library |

All cron endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`.

## Coding style
- TypeScript everywhere
- Server components by default; use `'use client'` only when needed
- Prefer Supabase RLS over API route auth checks
- Use `zod` for all API input validation
- Meaningful variable names — this codebase may be read by a non-engineer
- Comment complex logic clearly
